<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>A bit of a cheat as it is a trilogy.  This fantasy epic is exceptional in every way, and no matter how many times I watch it, I will never tire of it.</p>

<h3>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</h3>
<p>Excellent fight sequences, and Tan Dun's music adds incredible ambience.</p>

<h3>Cloud Atlas</h3>
<p>Several seemingly different storylines become interconnected in a very interesting way.</p>
